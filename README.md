# 01_LoginDemo
Demo of firebase login

This is a application where the user logins to get a quote of the day.

At the landing page, the user is asked to Login.
Users who are not logged in will only see a generic "hello my friend".
Once a user signs up, they can update profile to include more information.
When the user logs out, the quote of the day will disappear, and user returned to the landing page.
